Installation

Clone the repository or download the source code.
Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
Run the following command to install the dependencies

npm install



Configuration

Open the server.js file in a text editor.
Locate the following line of code:
javascriptCopymongoose.connect('mongodb+srv://risabht043:Skt230144@cluster0.30tgn5p.mongodb.net/', {
  useNewUrlParser: true,
  useUnifiedTopology: true,
})
Replace the MongoDB connection URL with your own MongoDB connection string. If you're using MongoDB Atlas, you can obtain the connection string from your Atlas dashboard.
Save the server.js file.


Running the Server

In the terminal, run the following command to start the server:
bashCopynpm start
This command will start the server using Nodemon, which will automatically restart the server whenever changes are made to the code.



The server will start running on http://localhost:5000 by default. You should see the following output in the terminal:


Server is running on port 5000
Connected to MongoDB
